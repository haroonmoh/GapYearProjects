# GapYearProjects
This repo will be all the projects that I develop during my gap year. I want to keep track of all the projects I make and share them with the world.

A lot of my projects will be revolved around machine learning because that is what I am interested in. NLP is the particular field that I really enjoy.

I hope that I can make the most of this time to code.
